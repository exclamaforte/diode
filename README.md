# diode
`diode` is a framework that makes it easy to develop heuristics that plug into the external interfaces of `torch` and `torch.compile`. It allows users to both gather data from torch and train models on the gathered data.

## Target Audience:
- Hardware Vendors looking to optimize `torch` heuristics for their hardware.
- OSS Contributors looking to add support for less popular hardware.
- Developers looking to adapt the compilation of their model to their specific situation.

## Features:
- Pre-Trained Models: Profit from community efforts to gather data and train models.
- Data collection: Gather data from torch external interfaces.
- Stable Type Definitions: storing data from the external interfaces.
- Model Training Code: Train ML models on the gathered data and contribute back to the `torch` community.
- Caching code: Create Lookup Tables (LUT) to ensure maximum performance.

## Common Herustic Types
- ML Models: Collect and train on data directly from `torch`.
- Lookup Tables: Build a json based lookup table that's editable by external tools like `jq`.
- Custom Logic: Come with your own ideas/functions.

## Featured Heruistics
- Matmul Kernel Prediction: Predict the runtime of matmul kernel.

## Model Organization

### Directory Structure
Models are organized in a structured directory format:
```
diode-models/diode_models/<heuristic>/<hardware>/model
```

For example:
```
diode-models/diode_models/matmul/nvidia-h100/matmul_nvidia_h100_deep.pt
```
